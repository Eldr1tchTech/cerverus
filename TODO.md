# TODO
 - Finish the route_trie
 - Create an linked-list and trie data structure so that I don't just have random data strucutres built from scrratch everywhere.
   - Choose a good name for a folder where I put all these.
   - Decide if there will be specific 'inherited' versions for each application, or if they have to deal with supporting casting/void pointers/and the likes.
 - Create an benchmark timer to time certain operations and figure out specific optimizations, at least collect numbers, optimization is not yet required at this point
